##Purpose
A simple library manager, with support of adding, deleting, updating and removing to/from a Mongo collection through Spring MVC also using Angular. Tests with Mockito FW

##Data
Data is on MongoDB and managed through DAO level manipulations via Spring interfaces

##Services
Services use a simple one-paged JSP beneath

##Controllers
In terms of service, controlling utility is heavily on Java app side. AngularJS is only manipulating data for view.

#Outcome
For a long time now, mockito is the best thing/lib/imagination/idea I have ever came across.
